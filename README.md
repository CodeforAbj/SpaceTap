# SpaceTap - Telegram Mini App Game

Welcome to **SpaceTap** â€“ a thrilling, tap-based game on Telegram where you pilot a rocket through space, gathering points and aiming for high scores! Challenge yourself and your friends to see who can reach the farthest corners of the universe. ðŸš€

## Overview

This project integrates a React frontend with a Supabase backend and Telegram bot as an entry point, creating a seamless experience from bot interaction to a live frontend demo. Key components include:

- Frontend: Built with React and Context API for state management, leveraging Apollo Client to make GraphQL requests. The frontend is accessible directly via URL, but will display a demo user by default if accessed without bot authentication.

- Backend: Uses Supabase as a realtime, scalable database for efficient data storage and retrieval. Supabase also serves as the GraphQL server to handle data fetching and persistence.

- Entry Point: A Telegram Bot created with Node.js and Express, utilizing Telegramâ€™s API library. This bot acts as the primary access point to authenticate users before redirecting them to the main frontend.
